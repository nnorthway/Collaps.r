### v.3
v.3 updates include improved mobile support for handheld devices and a fixed top bar on mobile devices to account for longer page sizes on smaller width screens.
Any questions, comments, concerns, or otherwise can be directed to northwayn@gmail.com

### What's to Come
v.3.1 will include better tablet, wearable, and different screen size compatability. In a future version I want to include dropdown menus. Any suggestions for better functionality or design are accepted & appreciated at northwayn@gmail.com
